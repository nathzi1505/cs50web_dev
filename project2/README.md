# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Here we design a web application that is similar on lines with Slack hence we name it Flask Slack or Flack. This project contains the following files :

1. `application.py` : This is the main on which the whole web application is based.
2. `folder : templates` : This is a folder that contains all the `HTML` templates that are used by this web application.
3. `folder : static` : This folder contains the `layout.css` file which controls the style of the webpage.
4. `requirements.txt` : This contains all the `python` packages that must be installed so as to make the web application run.
5. Personal touch : A delete recent message feature has been added, this helps to delete a message which the user might have accidentally added.
