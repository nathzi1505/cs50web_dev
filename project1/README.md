# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Here we developed a flask app which basically gives information on books contained in that `books.csv` file along with date pulled from goodreads using their api. This project contains the following files:

1. `application.py` : This is the main file on which the whole web application is based.
2. `books.csv` : This is the csv file containing all the information about those books.
3. `helpers.py` : This contains information about the `@login_required` and `hash` function which is used in many app routes.
4. `import.py` : This helps to extract the information from the csv file and uploads the database stored in Heroku.
5. `requirements.txt` : This contains all the `python` packages that must be installed so as to make the web application run.
6. `folder : templates` : This is a folder that contains all the `HTML` templates that are used by this web application.
7. `folder : static` : This folder contains the `layout.css` file which controls the style of the webpage.
