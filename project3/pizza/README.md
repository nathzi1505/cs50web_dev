# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Here we design a web application that provides a gateway for interested customers to order their favourite dishes from Pinnochio's pizza.

(All these below mentioned files belong to the app `orders` inside `pizza`)

1. `views.py` : This is the main on which determines the views(i.e. routes) of the entires web application.
2. `models.py` : This is the place where all the models (i.e. database tables) are present.
3. `urls.py` : This does the work similar to the telephone operator as in early days.
4. `admin.py` : Configures the django adminer so as to modify the restaurant menu easily.

5. `folder : templates` : This is a folder that contains all the `HTML` templates that are used by this web application.
6. `folder : static` : This folder contains the `layout.css` file which controls the style of the webpages.
7. `requirements.txt` : This contains all the `python` packages that must be installed so as to make the web application run.

8. Personal touch : An email functionality has been added in which customers get the free service of receiving confirmation of successful order placement.
